    <h1>Homemade Smash Burgers</h1>
    <img src="./images/homemadesmashburgers.jpg">
    <h2>Yummy Burgers</h2>
    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super yummy burgers with cripsy edges.
        Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the 
        meat is ver cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen.
        These grill up very fast because the higher heat, so make sure you have everything ready to
        go! 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80%lean)</li>
        <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdor grill for high heat and lightly oil the 
            grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet
            onto the grill and preheat until smoking
        </li>
        <li>Spread butter on the inside af the buns and toast on the flat-top until
            lightly browned. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-parcked balls, 2 ounches each. Do not pack 
            meat tightly, as it will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each
            ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent
            sticking on the soatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty)
            and immediately smash down toa 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy
            spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down.
            You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.
        </li>
        <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers
            are light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape
            up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese- 
            covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve
            with your favorite toppings.
        </li>
    </ol>
