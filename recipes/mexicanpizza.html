    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vagetable oil</li>
    <li>4 (6 inch) corn tortilas</li>
    <li>8 ounces shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>8 tablespoons sour cream</li>
    <li>2 roma (prum) tomatoes, chopped</li>

   <li>Heat the refried beans.</li>
   <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef. Stir in the seasoning packet</li>
   <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C)</li>
   <li>Place a small amount of vegatable oil in a large skillet. Let the oil heat,
    then place one corn tortilla in the skillet. After 15 seconds, flip the tortilla
    over and let it fry another 15 seconds. Repeat this process with the
    remaining tortillas, letting them drain on paper towels once they have been
    heated. When the tortillas have drained, arrange them on a cookie sheet.

   <li>Spread a thin layer of beans on the tortillas, followed by a layer of beef,
    and cheese.
   </li>
<li>Bake the tortillas in a preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes. Slice the 
    tortillas into wedges and arrange them on plates or a serving platter and 
    garnish them with the sour crean, tomatoes, green onions, chiles,
    avocado, and olives.
